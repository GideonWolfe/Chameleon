# Chameleon Color Scheme Script

This is a simple script that changes your system colorscheme and it's written in python.

## Add your own custom script

Now, if you want the python file `chameleon.py` to generate a theme for something that isn't already there, you can add your own. It's very simple. But, you are going to need some python knowledge.

Now, to run the script, just run:

```bash
sudo make
chameleon.py --help 
```
